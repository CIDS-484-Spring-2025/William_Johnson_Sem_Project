Monopoly but actually fun

For my semester project, I’m redesigning the board game Monopoly. This game has an iconic status, but also one that is widely recognized for its inherently flawed design. It's commonly criticized for its excessive game length, heavy reliance on luck, and lack of meaningful decision-making, all of which can lead to a frustrating experience. My goal is to retain the core theme of Monopoly while introducing new mechanics that make it more strategic, dynamic, and enjoyable.

The most significant change is allowing players to move clockwise or counterclockwise each turn, rather than being restricted to a single direction. This seemingly small shift adds a layer of strategy to movement and property acquisition, encouraging players to plan their routes and react to board conditions. To support the new movement system, the traditional “pass GO and collect $200” rule has been replaced with a consistent $100 income at the start of each turn.

I’ve also added a new non-player character: Mike the Tax Collector. Mike moves clockwise around the board at half the distance of player dice rolls (rounded down). If Mike lands adjacent to a player, that player must pay $100. This creates a new spatial hazard and encourages players to think more tactically about their position and movement.

To add variety and player agency, the game includes items and perks. These are drawn from Community Chest and Chance Time, and their effects include:

A dice reroll,

The ability to send another player to jail,

Immunity from Mike,

Immunity to Jail,

Etc.


This redesign keeps the spirit of Monopoly while fixing its major flaws, creating a faster, more strategic, and genuinely fun experience.
