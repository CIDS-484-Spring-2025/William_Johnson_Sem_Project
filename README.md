Monopoly but actually fun

I am remaking the board game Monopoly, but with a few rule chanes to make it more fun. For example, players can choose to move clockwise or counter clockwise whenever they move. This single change introduces a bunch of crazy side effects and other changes to make this not awful, such as GO not giving you any money when passing it. Instead you will gain $50 at the start of every turn. Another change is the inclusion of the tax collector, who is named Mike. Mike will circle the board clockwise and always move half of what the players rolled their dice, rounded down. If Mike lands next to you, you lose $100. I'm also hoping to add some consumable items, such as the ability to reroll your dice or send someone else to jail. Also maybe some perks, like immunnity to Mike or reactivating GO to give you money when passing it again. These would be found in community chest, and while not essential, they would make the game much more fun.
